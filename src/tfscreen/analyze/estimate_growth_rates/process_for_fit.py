    1. Infer lnA0 and lnA0 for all genotypes in each sample. This is lnA0 at the 
       start of selection, after a pre-selection outgrowth in the relevant IPTG
       concentration.
    2. Calculate the expected growth of each genotype in each sample over the

       all samples. Weight mean and stdev by 1/parameter_std_err^2.

    Process dataframes for fitting growth parameters.

    This function takes two dataframes, a combined dataframe containing
    sequence counts, cfu_mL, and total reads, as well as a sample dataframe
    specifying the conditions for each sample. The function performs several
    processing steps to prepare the data for fitting. These steps include:

        1. Combining the dataframes to yield numpy arrays of times, cfu, and 
           ln_cfu. 
        2. Estimating and adding a t = 0 datapoint for each genotype in each 
           sample.
        3. Generating plausible initial guesses of growth rate for further
           regression.

    The analysis assumes that combined_df is sorted by genotype, then sample. 
    The combined_df should be exhaustive, having all genotypes in all 
    samples. Genotypes not seen in a particular sample should still be 
    present, just given counts of zero.

    sample_df : str
        sample dataframe. This dataframe should have columns "marker", "select"
        and "iptg" and be indexed by 'sample' (replicate|marker|select|iptg)
    pseudocount : int or float, optional
        Pseudocount added to sequence counts to avoid division by zero when
